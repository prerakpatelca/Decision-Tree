# Decision-Tree
Obtained some machine learning data for classification, tested several versions of the Decision Tree learner using that data, and then wrote a short report on your findings.

This is a python program where we are reading CSV file with the dataset of Breast Cancer with label of Benign or Malignant and features attached with it. We are shuffling the data set and we will use first 80% of the data set in training set and other 20% of the data set in testing data. We will use Decision Tree Algorithm to train and test the data to return the accuracy of the algorithm.
